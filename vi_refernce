While retaining coverage of the vi clones, nvi, elvis, and vile, this edition offers expanded coverage of the Vim editor,which has become the de facto standard version of vi in the GNU/Linux world.

The Solaris version of vi served as the "reference"bersion of the original vi for this pocket reference.
